             Angular 7 uses the "ng-template" as the tag instead of "template" which is used in Angular2. "ng-template" 
             has been in use since the release of Angular 4 , and the earlier version i.e Angular 2 uses "template"
              for the same purpose. The reason it started to use "ng-template" instead of "template" from Angular 4 onwards 
              is because there is a name conflict between the "template" tag and the html "template" standard tag. 
              It will deprecate completely going ahead. This was one of the major changes made in Angular 4 version.
